# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It covers definitions, importance, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, using a booking management system as a case study.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis, also known as Requirements Engineering, is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a new or modified product. It ensures that the software system aligns with user expectations and business objectives.

This process involves various activities such as eliciting requirements, analyzing them for feasibility, documenting them in a structured format, and validating them with stakeholders. Effective requirement analysis is crucial for the success of any software project, as it lays the foundation for design, development, and testing phases.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is vital in the SDLC for several reasons:

- **Clarity and Understanding**: It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project requirements, reducing ambiguities and misunderstandings.
- **Scope Management**: By clearly defining what is to be built, it helps in managing the project scope and prevents scope creep.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifying potential issues early in the development process allows for proactive risk management.
- **Cost and Time Efficiency**: Well-defined requirements help in accurate estimation of resources, leading to efficient allocation of time and budget.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The key activities involved in Requirement Analysis include:

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Engaging with stakeholders to uncover their needs and expectations.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Recording the gathered requirements in a structured and understandable format.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, and representing them using models.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are agreed upon by all parties.

## Types of Requirements

Requirements are generally categorized into two types:

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the specific behavior or functions of a system. For the booking management system, examples include:

- Users can search for available bookings.
- Users can make a reservation.
- Users can cancel a reservation.
- Administrators can add or remove listings.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. Examples include:

- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Reliability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
- **Security**: User data should be encrypted and comply with data protection regulations.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help in identifying the functional requirements of a system.

Below is a use case diagram for the booking management system:

_Note: The diagram illustrates actors such as 'User' and 'Administrator' interacting with use cases like 'Search Listings', 'Make Reservation', 'Cancel Reservation', and 'Manage Listings'._

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user or other stakeholders. They are used to confirm when a feature is complete and working as intended.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria

- They provide a clear understanding of the feature's scope.
- They serve as a basis for test cases.
- They help in achieving stakeholder alignment.

### Example: Checkout Feature in Booking Management System

- Users must be able to review their booking details before confirming.
- The system must calculate the total cost, including taxes and fees.
- Users must receive a confirmation email upon successful booking.
- Payment processing must be secure and comply with PCI DSS standards.
